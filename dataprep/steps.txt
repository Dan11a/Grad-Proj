->first I ran add_path file to add the path for each video in the archive to the instance entry inside the WLASL_v0.3 file.
->then I ran del_missing to delete all the vidoe instances insdie WLASL_v0.3 without a path (meaning the video doesn't exist in the archive)
->after deleting missing video instance I added a 'frame_count' attribute to the existing videos by add_framecount
->after that i redefiened the splits making sure every gloss has at least one test split  and one validation split by running splits_edit 
  and saved the outcome file as split_data
->then I ran work_data to reshape the structure of the json file and saved it as WLASL_v0.4
-> lastly I created 3 json files, one conatining the trainig instance, and one for the test and one for validation by running split_file for easier managment
